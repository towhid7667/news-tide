                    without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

                    Arrow functions allow a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and
                    approximately half the typing. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions don’t have their own
                    this or arguments binding. Instead, those identifiers are resolved in the lexical scope like any
                    other variable. Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in
                    regular functions. Regular functions created through function declarations / expressions are
                    both constructible and callable. Arrow functions (and methods) are only callable i.e arrow
                    functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the
                    new keyword.

                    .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
                    updated elements.
                    .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change
                    the array and it returns undefined.
                    .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a
                    new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                    The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method
                    executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements
                    are found.

                    Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                    older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
                    dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are
                    functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great
                    for converting strings to different entities. Another great feature of template strings is that
                    we can have strings with multiple lines for better code readability. This cannot be done in an
                    easy way with the old style of strings.
